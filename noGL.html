This webpage requires webGL, a new 3D native browser capability being developed by the Khronos group.  Information on how to obtain a compatible browser can be found here:

<br><br>
Please note that at this time (March 2, 2010) there seems to be a problem with the latest builds of webkit.  The last version known to work properly
with our application is r55043.  That version (for MacOS) can be downloaded here:

<a href="http://builds.nightly.webkit.org/files/trunk/mac/WebKit-SVN-r55043.dmg">webkit r55043</a>
<br><br>

The Chromium and Webkit browsers seem to perform better than Firefox at this point, and we recommend them as the preferred browsers for KataJS.

<br><br>
After installing a webGL-enabled browser, please come back to this page.
